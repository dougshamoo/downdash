# downdash - Get down with the lodash library and functional programming
The dowdash project utilizes [lodash](https://lodash.com/) helper methods and the [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) testing framework to teach the lodash library and functional programming concepts.

### How to get started
Opening DownDashRunner.html in your browser will reveal multiple failed tests. Your goal is to get all of these tests to pass!

Fix each test by implementing the corresponding helper method. Refresh the page and the tests should turn green if all requirements are met.

Once all of your tests have passed you will have mastered the basics of functional programming and the lodash utility library.
